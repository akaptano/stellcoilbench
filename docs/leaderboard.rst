StellCoilBench Leaderboard
===========================

The StellCoilBench leaderboard provides a comprehensive comparison of coil optimization
methods across different plasma surfaces. Each submission is evaluated using standardized
metrics that measure both the quality of the magnetic field produced and the engineering
feasibility of the coil designs.

.. note::
   This page is automatically regenerated by CI after each successful submission.
   For local development, run ``stellcoilbench update-db`` to refresh the leaderboard.
